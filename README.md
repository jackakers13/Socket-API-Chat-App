# CS4850 Project
A simple chat room service comprised of a client and a server that
utilize the socket API. Implemented using Java 8; built and tested on Windows 10.
## How Do I Compile/Run it?
The project is written in Java 8, so the [Java 8 JDK](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8-MR3) is required. The client and server are separate apps; each is compiled/run primitively using `javac` and `java` at the command line. **This project was built and tested on Windows 10**, so I have provided batch scripts (`Client.bat` and `Server.bat`) to compile and run each program in a single command.
